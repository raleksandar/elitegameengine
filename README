This is one of my old projects I've recently found.
It supposed to be a game framework (not a game engine, despite it's name) but it was never finished.
I've decided to put it online somewhere just in case someone needs it...

EGE is written in FreeBASIC and tested on Windows only. I do not remember compiler version which was
used to compile the code and since I've stopped following FreeBASIC project few years back I do not
know if recent compiler would be able to compile it.
